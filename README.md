# To-Do List Website

A simple and interactive to-do list web application built from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

This project serves as a practical exercise and a clear demonstration of fundamental front-end web development concepts. It's an ideal resource for anyone looking to understand the basics of creating dynamic web interfaces, DOM manipulation, and event handling without relying on frameworks.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your list.
* **Mark as Complete:** Toggle tasks as complete or incomplete.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
* **Clear All Completed:** Quickly remove all completed tasks. (If you have this feature)
* **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even after closing the tab. (If you have this feature)
* **Responsive Design:** (If applicable) The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the web page.
* **CSS3:** For styling and making the application visually appealing.
* **JavaScript:** For all interactive functionalities, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence.
